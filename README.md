# Ticketz ðŸŽ«
Just a simple test of my JS skills, I want to fake a ticket reading system which will include features such as:
- Providing the neccesary info about each passenger
- Adding new passengers if they do meet the criteria and the system hasn't reached max capacity
- Showing how much each family/group has to pay

And hopefully, once the rest of that is done, I can display it beautifully with some UI magic! âœ¨
